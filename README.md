# HeteSim

Academic programming project at FIB, UPC.

HeteSim is a program to make relational (and normal/simple) searches in a database composed as a graph. The database used for the implementation is the collection of names from different items (of different types) from a computer science public library.

For try it, you can import the full library located at /data or create your own.

This project uses another open source library called GraphStream for the visualization of the graph.
